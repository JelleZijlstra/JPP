<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project implements phylogenetic inference using maximum parsimony (MP). Its input is a list of taxa (e.g., animal species) with their states for a variety of characters and its output is a tree that describes their relationships. This method is used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among different organisms.</p>
